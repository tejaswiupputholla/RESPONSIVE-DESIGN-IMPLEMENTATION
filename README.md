## DESCRIPTION OF TASK 2:
 This task involved building a responsive  personal portfolio webpage that showcases my profile, skills, education, internships, and projects. The main goal was to ensure the layout looks   clean and functional on all screen sizes using responsive design techniques.
The webpage was created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the hamburger menu toggle on mobile devices. The layout adapts to different screen widths using CSS media queries, maintaining a user-friendly interface without breaking the design flow.
